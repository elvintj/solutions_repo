# Interference Patterns on a Water Surface

## Problem Analysis
This assignment explores the interference patterns created by multiple wave sources arranged in a regular polygon configuration. We'll analyze how waves from these sources interact to create regions of constructive and destructive interference.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Choosing a Regular Polygon
I've selected a square (4-sided regular polygon) for this analysis, as it provides an interesting but computationally manageable configuration.

### 2. Mathematical Formulation
For N point sources arranged in a regular polygon, each source emits a circular wave described by:
