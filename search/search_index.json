Our task involves: Selecting a regular polygon and placing wave sources at its vertices. Writing the wave equations for each source. Applying the principle of superposition to sum the displacements. Analyzing the resulting interference patterns. Visualizing the patterns graphically. Variant A - Square as a Regular Polygon Step 1: Select a Regular Polygon Let\u2019s choose a square as our regular polygon. A square has 4 vertices, so we will have \\(N = 4\\) point sources. We\u2019ll place the square in the \\(xy\\) -plane, centered at the origin \\((0, 0)\\) , with a side length of \\(2a\\) . For simplicity, let\u2019s set \\(a = 1\\) , so the side length is 2 units. The vertices of the square are: Vertex 1: \\((1, 1)\\) Vertex 2: \\((1, -1)\\) Vertex 3: \\((-1, -1)\\) Vertex 4: \\((-1, 1)\\) Each vertex will be a point source emitting circular waves. Step 2: Position the Sources The positions of the sources are: Source 1: \\((x_1, y_1) = (1, 1)\\) Source 2: \\((x_2, y_2) = (1, -1)\\) Source 3: \\((x_3, y_3) = (-1, -1)\\) Source 4: \\((x_4, y_4) = (-1, 1)\\) Step 3: Wave Equations Each source emits a wave of the form: \\[ \\eta_i(x, y, t) = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{r_i}} \\cdot \\cos(k r_i - \\omega t + \\phi_i) \\] where \\(r_i = \\sqrt{(x - x_i)^2 + (y - y_i)^2}\\) is the distance from the \\(i\\) -th source to the point \\((x, y)\\) . Assumptions: All sources have the same amplitude \\(A\\) . All sources have the same wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) and frequency \\(f\\) , so \\(k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\) and \\(\\omega = 2\\pi f\\) are the same for all sources. The waves are coherent, meaning the phase difference between sources is constant. For simplicity, let\u2019s assume the initial phase \\(\\phi_i = 0\\) for all sources (i.e., all sources are in phase). Let\u2019s set some numerical values for the parameters: Amplitude \\(A = 1\\) , Wavelength \\(\\lambda = 1\\) , so \\(k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} = 2\\pi\\) , Frequency \\(f = 1\\) , so \\(\\omega = 2\\pi f = 2\\pi\\) , Initial phase \\(\\phi_i = 0\\) . Thus, the wave equation for the \\(i\\) -th source becomes: \\[ \\eta_i(x, y, t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r_i}} \\cdot \\cos(2\\pi r_i - 2\\pi t) \\] where: \\(r_1 = \\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2}\\) , \\(r_2 = \\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2}\\) , \\(r_3 = \\sqrt{(x + 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2}\\) , \\(r_4 = \\sqrt{(x + 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2}\\) . Step 4: Superposition of Waves The total displacement at a point \\((x, y)\\) at time \\(t\\) is the sum of the displacements from all sources: \\[ \\eta(x, y, t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\eta_i(x, y, t) \\] For our square with 4 sources: \\[ \\eta(x, y, t) = \\eta_1 + \\eta_2 + \\eta_3 + \\eta_4 \\] \\[ \\eta(x, y, t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r_i}} \\cdot \\cos(2\\pi r_i - 2\\pi t) \\] Step 5: Analyze Interference Patterns To analyze the interference patterns, we need to compute \\(\\eta(x, y, t)\\) over a grid of points \\((x, y)\\) at a specific time \\(t\\) . Let\u2019s fix \\(t = 0\\) for simplicity, so the equation becomes: \\[ \\eta(x, y, 0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r_i}} \\cdot \\cos(2\\pi r_i) \\] Constructive Interference: Constructive interference occurs when the waves from different sources are in phase, i.e., when the phase difference \\(k(r_i - r_j)\\) between any two sources is an integer multiple of \\(2\\pi\\) . This happens when: \\[ |r_i - r_j| = m \\lambda \\quad (m = 0, 1, 2, \\dots) \\] Since \\(\\lambda = 1\\) , constructive interference occurs when the path difference \\(|r_i - r_j|\\) is an integer. Destructive Interference: Destructive interference occurs when the waves are out of phase by \\(\\pi\\) radians, i.e., when: \\[ |r_i - r_j| = \\left(m + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\lambda \\quad (m = 0, 1, 2, \\dots) \\] For \\(\\lambda = 1\\) , this happens when the path difference is a half-integer (e.g., 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, ...). We\u2019ll visualize the total displacement \\(\\eta(x, y, 0)\\) to identify these regions. Step 6: Visualization Below is a Python script that computes and visualizes the interference pattern using NumPy and Matplotlib. The script creates a 2D grid of points, calculates the total displacement, and plots the result as a heatmap. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Parameters A = 1.0 # Amplitude lambda_ = 1.0 # Wavelength k = 2 * np.pi / lambda_ # Wave number t = 0.0 # Time (fixed at t=0 for visualization) # Define the positions of the sources (vertices of a square) sources = [ (1, 1), # Source 1 (1, -1), # Source 2 (-1, -1), # Source 3 (-1, 1) # Source 4 ] # Create a grid of points x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100) # x-range y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100) # y-range X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y) # Initialize the total displacement eta = np.zeros_like(X) # Sum the contributions from each source for (x0, y0) in sources: # Distance from the source to each point on the grid r = np.sqrt((X - x0)**2 + (Y - y0)**2) # Avoid division by zero at the source r = np.where(r < 1e-6, 1e-6, r) # Wave contribution from this source eta += (A / np.sqrt(r)) * np.cos(k * r) # Plot the interference pattern plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8)) plt.contourf(X, Y, eta, cmap='seismic', levels=50) plt.colorbar(label='Displacement') plt.scatter([s[0] for s in sources], [s[1] for s in sources], c='black', marker='o', label='Sources') plt.title('Interference Pattern from Four Sources (Square)') plt.xlabel('x') plt.ylabel('y') plt.legend() plt.grid(True) plt.show() Visualization of the script Plot: Interference Pattern: Explanation of the Code Parameters : We define the amplitude \\(A\\) , wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) , wave number \\(k\\) , and time \\(t\\) . Sources : The positions of the four sources are defined as the vertices of the square. Grid : A 2D grid of points \\((x, y)\\) is created using np.meshgrid over the range \\([-5, 5] \\times [-5, 5]\\) . Displacement Calculation : For each source, we compute the distance \\(r_i\\) to every point on the grid, then add the wave contribution \\(\\frac{A}{\\sqrt{r_i}} \\cos(k r_i)\\) to the total displacement. Visualization : The total displacement is plotted as a heatmap using plt.contourf . The seismic colormap highlights positive (red) and negative (blue) displacements, making it easy to see constructive and destructive interference. The sources are marked with black dots. Step 7: Interpretation of Results When you run the script, you\u2019ll see a heatmap showing the interference pattern. Here\u2019s what to look for: Constructive Interference : Regions where the displacement is large (bright red or blue) indicate constructive interference, where the waves from multiple sources add up in phase. Destructive Interference : Regions where the displacement is near zero (white) indicate destructive interference, where the waves cancel each other out. Symmetry : Since the sources are at the vertices of a square, the interference pattern will exhibit four-fold symmetry. You\u2019ll notice repeating patterns along the axes and diagonals. Observations: Near the sources, the waves are strong (large displacement) because of the \\(1/\\sqrt{r}\\) term. Along the lines connecting pairs of sources (e.g., \\((1, 1)\\) to \\((1, -1)\\) ), you\u2019ll see alternating regions of constructive and destructive interference due to the changing path difference. At the center \\((0, 0)\\) , the distances from all four sources are equal ( \\(r = \\sqrt{2}\\) ), so the waves arrive with the same phase, leading to constructive interference. Variant B - Equilateral Triangle as a Regular Polygon Step 1: Select a Regular Polygon Let\u2019s choose an equilateral triangle as our regular polygon. An equilateral triangle has 3 vertices, so we will have \\(N = 3\\) point sources. We\u2019ll place the triangle in the \\(xy\\) -plane, centered at the origin \\((0, 0)\\) , with a side length of \\(s\\) . For simplicity, let\u2019s set \\(s = 2\\) . To find the coordinates of the vertices of an equilateral triangle centered at the origin: The distance from the center to each vertex (circumradius) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(s\\) is given by \\(R = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\\) . For \\(s = 2\\) , the circumradius is \\(R = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547\\) . The vertices of the equilateral triangle, with the first vertex at angle \\(0^\\circ\\) (along the positive \\(x\\) -axis), are: Vertex 1: \\((R, 0) = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}, 0\\right) \\approx (1.1547, 0)\\) , Vertex 2: \\((R \\cos 120^\\circ, R \\sin 120^\\circ) = \\left(-\\frac{R}{2}, R \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}, 1\\right) \\approx (-0.5774, 1)\\) , Vertex 3: \\((R \\cos 240^\\circ, R \\sin 240^\\circ) = \\left(-\\frac{R}{2}, -R \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}, -1\\right) \\approx (-0.5774, -1)\\) . Each vertex will be a point source emitting circular waves. Step 2: Position the Sources The positions of the sources are: Source 1: \\((x_1, y_1) = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}, 0\\right) \\approx (1.1547, 0)\\) , Source 2: \\((x_2, y_2) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}, 1\\right) \\approx (-0.5774, 1)\\) , Source 3: \\((x_3, y_3) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}, -1\\right) \\approx (-0.5774, -1)\\) . Step 3: Wave Equations Each source emits a wave of the form: \\[ \\eta_i(x, y, t) = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{r_i}} \\cdot \\cos(k r_i - \\omega t + \\phi_i) \\] where \\(r_i = \\sqrt{(x - x_i)^2 + (y - y_i)^2}\\) is the distance from the \\(i\\) -th source to the point \\((x, y)\\) . Assumptions: All sources have the same amplitude \\(A\\) . All sources have the same wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) and frequency \\(f\\) , so \\(k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\) and \\(\\omega = 2\\pi f\\) are the same for all sources. The waves are coherent, meaning the phase difference between sources is constant. For simplicity, let\u2019s assume the initial phase \\(\\phi_i = 0\\) for all sources (i.e., all sources are in phase). Let\u2019s set the same numerical values for the parameters as before: Amplitude \\(A = 1\\) , Wavelength \\(\\lambda = 1\\) , so \\(k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} = 2\\pi\\) , Frequency \\(f = 1\\) , so \\(\\omega = 2\\pi f = 2\\pi\\) , Initial phase \\(\\phi_i = 0\\) . Thus, the wave equation for the \\(i\\) -th source becomes: \\[ \\eta_i(x, y, t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r_i}} \\cdot \\cos(2\\pi r_i - 2\\pi t) \\] where: \\(r_1 = \\sqrt{\\left(x - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 + (y - 0)^2}\\) , \\(r_2 = \\sqrt{\\left(x + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 + (y - 1)^2}\\) , \\(r_3 = \\sqrt{\\left(x + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 + (y + 1)^2}\\) . Step 4: Superposition of Waves The total displacement at a point \\((x, y)\\) at time \\(t\\) is the sum of the displacements from all sources: \\[ \\eta(x, y, t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\eta_i(x, y, t) \\] For our equilateral triangle with 3 sources: \\[ \\eta(x, y, t) = \\eta_1 + \\eta_2 + \\eta_3 \\] \\[ \\eta(x, y, t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r_i}} \\cdot \\cos(2\\pi r_i - 2\\pi t) \\] Step 5: Analyze Interference Patterns To analyze the interference patterns, we compute \\(\\eta(x, y, t)\\) over a grid of points \\((x, y)\\) at a specific time \\(t\\) . Let\u2019s fix \\(t = 0\\) for simplicity, so the equation becomes: \\[ \\eta(x, y, 0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r_i}} \\cdot \\cos(2\\pi r_i) \\] Constructive Interference: Constructive interference occurs when the waves from different sources are in phase, i.e., when the phase difference \\(k(r_i - r_j)\\) between any two sources is an integer multiple of \\(2\\pi\\) : \\[ |r_i - r_j| = m \\lambda \\quad (m = 0, 1, 2, \\dots) \\] Since \\(\\lambda = 1\\) , constructive interference occurs when the path difference \\(|r_i - r_j|\\) is an integer. Destructive Interference: Destructive interference occurs when the waves are out of phase by \\(\\pi\\) radians, i.e., when: \\[ |r_i - r_j| = \\left(m + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\lambda \\quad (m = 0, 1, 2, \\dots) \\] For \\(\\lambda = 1\\) , this happens when the path difference is a half-integer (e.g., 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, ...). We\u2019ll visualize the total displacement \\(\\eta(x, y, 0)\\) to identify these regions. Step 6: Visualization Below is a Python script that computes and visualizes the interference pattern using NumPy and Matplotlib. The script creates a 2D grid of points, calculates the total displacement, and plots the result as a heatmap. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Parameters A = 1.0 # Amplitude lambda_ = 1.0 # Wavelength k = 2 * np.pi / lambda_ # Wave number t = 0.0 # Time (fixed at t=0 for visualization) # Define the positions of the sources (vertices of an equilateral triangle) R = 2 / np.sqrt(3) # Circumradius of the triangle with side length 2 sources = [ (R, 0), # Source 1 (-R/2, R * np.sqrt(3)/2), # Source 2 (-R/2, -R * np.sqrt(3)/2) # Source 3 ] # Create a grid of points x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100) # x-range y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100) # y-range X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y) # Initialize the total displacement eta = np.zeros_like(X) # Sum the contributions from each source for (x0, y0) in sources: # Distance from the source to each point on the grid r = np.sqrt((X - x0)**2 + (Y - y0)**2) # Avoid division by zero at the source r = np.where(r < 1e-6, 1e-6, r) # Wave contribution from this source eta += (A / np.sqrt(r)) * np.cos(k * r) # Plot the interference pattern plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8)) plt.contourf(X, Y, eta, cmap='seismic', levels=50) plt.colorbar(label='Displacement') plt.scatter([s[0] for s in sources], [s[1] for s in sources], c='black', marker='o', label='Sources') plt.title('Interference Pattern from Three Sources (Equilateral Triangle)') plt.xlabel('x') plt.ylabel('y') plt.legend() plt.grid(True) plt.show() Visualization of the script Plot: Interference Pattern: Explanation of the Code Parameters : We define the amplitude \\(A\\) , wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) , wave number \\(k\\) , and time \\(t\\) . Sources : The positions of the three sources are defined as the vertices of the equilateral triangle, calculated using the circumradius \\(R\\) . Grid : A 2D grid of points \\((x, y)\\) is created using np.meshgrid over the range \\([-5, 5] \\times [-5, 5]\\) . Displacement Calculation : For each source, we compute the distance \\(r_i\\) to every point on the grid, then add the wave contribution \\(\\frac{A}{\\sqrt{r_i}} \\cos(k r_i)\\) to the total displacement. Visualization : The total displacement is plotted as a heatmap using plt.contourf . The seismic colormap highlights positive (red) and negative (blue) displacements, making it easy to see constructive and destructive interference. The sources are marked with black dots. Step 7: Interpretation of Results When you run the script, you\u2019ll see a heatmap showing the interference pattern. Here\u2019s what to look for: Constructive Interference : Regions where the displacement is large (bright red or blue) indicate constructive interference, where the waves from multiple sources add up in phase. Destructive Interference : Regions where the displacement is near zero (white) indicate destructive interference, where the waves cancel each other out. Symmetry : Since the sources are at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, the interference pattern will exhibit three-fold symmetry. You\u2019ll notice repeating patterns along the directions of the triangle\u2019s axes of symmetry (at \\(0^\\circ\\) , \\(120^\\circ\\) , and \\(240^\\circ\\) ). Observations: Near the sources, the waves are strong (large displacement) because of the \\(1/\\sqrt{r}\\) term. Along the lines connecting pairs of sources (e.g., from \\((R, 0)\\) to \\(\\left(-\\frac{R}{2}, R \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\) ), you\u2019ll see alternating regions of constructive and destructive interference due to the changing path difference. At the center \\((0, 0)\\) , the distances from all three sources are equal ( \\(r = R = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\) ), so the waves arrive with the same phase, leading to constructive interference. Variant C - Animated Wave Evolution for Interference Patterns (Equilateral Triangle) Problem Recap We are analyzing the interference patterns formed on a water surface due to the superposition of circular waves emitted from three point sources placed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle. The wave equation for a single source is: \\[ \\eta(x, y, t) = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{r}} \\cdot \\cos(kr - \\omega t + \\phi) \\] where: \\(\\eta(x, y, t)\\) is the displacement of the water surface at point \\((x, y)\\) and time \\(t\\) , \\(A\\) is the amplitude, \\(k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\) is the wave number ( \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength), \\(\\omega = 2\\pi f\\) is the angular frequency ( \\(f\\) is the frequency), \\(r = \\sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}\\) is the distance from the source at \\((x_0, y_0)\\) , \\(\\phi\\) is the initial phase (set to 0 for simplicity). The sources are at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(s = 2\\) , centered at the origin: Source 1: \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}, 0\\right) \\approx (1.1547, 0)\\) , Source 2: \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}, 1\\right) \\approx (-0.5774, 1)\\) , Source 3: \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}, -1\\right) \\approx (-0.5774, -1)\\) . The total displacement is the sum of the contributions from all sources: \\[ \\eta(x, y, t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{r_i}} \\cdot \\cos(k r_i - \\omega t) \\] We\u2019ll use the same parameters as before: \\(A = 1\\) , \\(\\lambda = 1\\) , \\(k = 2\\pi\\) , \\(f = 1\\) , \\(\\omega = 2\\pi\\) .

Detailed Explanation of the Equivalent Resistance Algorithm Using Graph Theory Overview The algorithm calculates the equivalent resistance between two nodes in an electrical circuit by representing the circuit as a graph and iteratively simplifying it using series and parallel reduction rules. The circuit is modeled as a multi-graph , where: Nodes represent junction points in the circuit. Edges represent resistors, with the edge weight being the resistance value (in ohms, \u03a9). Multiple edges between the same pair of nodes are allowed, representing resistors in parallel. The algorithm iteratively applies two fundamental electrical rules\u2014series and parallel reductions\u2014until the graph is reduced to a single edge between the start and end nodes, whose weight is the equivalent resistance. The implementation uses the networkx library in Python to handle graph operations and matplotlib for visualization. Algorithm Steps The algorithm can be broken down into the following key steps: Graph Representation : - The circuit is represented as a nx.MultiGraph , which allows multiple edges between the same pair of nodes (important for parallel resistors). - Each edge has a weight attribute representing the resistance value. Series Reduction : - Identify nodes with exactly two neighbors (degree 2), which indicate resistors in series. - Combine the resistances of the two edges connected to this node by adding them. - Remove the intermediate node and replace the two edges with a single edge whose weight is the sum of the resistances. Parallel Reduction : - Identify pairs of nodes with multiple edges between them, indicating resistors in parallel. - Compute the equivalent resistance using the parallel formula: \\( \\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{R_n} \\) . - Remove all parallel edges and add a single edge with the equivalent resistance. Zero-Resistance Handling : - Identify edges with zero resistance (direct connections). - Contract the nodes connected by zero-resistance edges into a single node, effectively merging them since they are at the same electrical potential. Iterative Simplification : - Repeatedly apply series reduction, parallel reduction, and zero-resistance handling until no further simplifications are possible. - A safeguard (maximum iteration limit) prevents infinite loops in case the graph cannot be reduced further. Final Check : - Check if the final graph has a single edge between the specified start and end nodes. - If so, return the weight of that edge as the equivalent resistance; otherwise, return None to indicate an error. Analysis How It Handles Complex Configurations Series Detection : Identifies nodes with degree 2 and combines adjacent resistances Parallel Detection : Finds multiple edges between nodes and applies parallel formula Iterative Simplification : Repeatedly applies both reductions until circuit is fully simplified Efficiency Time Complexity : O(N * (E + V)) per iteration, where N is number of iterations Space Complexity : O(V + E) for graph storage Note : Number of iterations depends on circuit complexity Potential Improvements Adding delta-wye transformation for bridge circuits Implementing matrix-based methods (Kirchhoff's laws) for more complex cases Adding error checking for invalid configurations Optimizing by prioritizing certain reductions based on circuit structure","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/5%20Circuits/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/5%20Circuits/Problem_1/#equivalent-resistance-calculation-using-graph-theory","text":"","title":"Equivalent Resistance Calculation Using Graph Theory"},{"location":"1%20Physics/5%20Circuits/Problem_1/#algorithm-description","text":"In this solution, we will use a graph-based approach to calculate equivalent resistance by iteratively simplifying the circuit through series and parallel reductions.
